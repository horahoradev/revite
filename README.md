This is a fork of [Revite](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite) that I've ~~butchered~~modified to suit Horahora's needs. Credit for developing the original software goes to the [many contributors](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite/graphs/contributors), most notably [insertish](https://github.com/insertish). If you have any questions or concerns about what I've done, you may contact me at Otoman#6721 on Discord, my email (horahora1567@gmail.com) or anywhere else you happen to find me. Thank you for your work!

My changes are summarized below:

### 10-30-22:
- I removed browser detection from the login operation (may need this later, we'll see), and removed credentials and friendly_name from the payload to the /auth/session/login endpoint
- I removed the various authentication-related routes except for the default login path, removed the email/password form (replaced with a Button which invokes the login operation) from the login page in order to provide (bad) SSO from my other application, [Horahora](https://github.com/horahoradev/horahora). With these changes, users login once to Horahora, and then can navigate to the chat and press the big SSO login button, and they'll be logged into their Revolt account.
- removed typecheck and port exposure from Dockerfile
- modified this README to provide attribution and comply with the terms of the license

### 11-1-22:
- modified .env file to use my local API
- modified Dockerfile for hot reloads (development use)
- modified vite config to accommodate my path setup in Nginx

### 11-6-22:
- added functions representing Horahora's planned REST API for watch parties. These functions currently return placeholder data to test component display.
- added "WatchParty" component which currently only implements the basic display for planned channel watch party functionality
- added use of the "WatchParty" component to the standard TextChannel
- changed MessageArea CSS to make room for the new WatchParty component within the text channel

### 11-13-22:
- added buffer dependency to conv uuid to int (lol, WIP)
- implemented API and calls for basic interaction with Horahora's RESTful API for most basic watch party operations
- added form to add videos to video queue (very basic, will change later)

### 11-14-22:
- changed UI display on channel page: two columns, one for video embed/queue controls, one for chat
